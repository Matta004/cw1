After greeting the user, the program will ask them to "Enter key (Choose a word with no repeating letter[example: *keyword*]):".

must be an English word, but it must not contain duplicate characters or the letter "j". 
After entering the key, the program is going to save the key in a file, then you can encrypt or decrypt the text or exit the program. Select this after entering the key. As shown in the middle of (fig1.2), 
you can encrypt, decrypt, or exit the application. Option 1 executes the encryption algorithm and prompts you to enter an alphabetical word or phrase, 
as shown in the last section (fig1.2). For example, the user typed "Coventry" (fig1.3)

and the program output "LC UY MU AK" (fig1.3), 
which is the encrypted text we need. After this, It will save the encrypted text. Then the program will return to the point where you choose one of the three options from the previous paragraph. 
Decrypting the cipher text output requires pressing "2" to execute the decryption algorithm. After entering the text to be decrypted, as shown in (fig1.4),
the user will receive the decrypted text/phrase, which in this example was "COVENTRY" and will be saved in the decrypted text file, the word that was initially encrypted. If you press "3" to quit, 
the app will thank you and shut down.
