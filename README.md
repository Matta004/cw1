After greeting the user, the programme will tell them to "Enter key (Choose a word with no repeating letter[example: *keyword*]):". 
Keys are needed. This keyword, as shown in the first part of (fig1.2), can be any English word or phrase, but it must not contain duplicate characters. 
After entering the key, you can encrypt or decrypt the text or exit the programme. Select this after entering the key. As shown in the middle of (fig1.2), 
you can encrypt, decrypt, or exit the application. Option 1 executes the encryption algorithm and prompts you to enter an alphabetical word or phrase, 
as shown in the last section (fig1.2). For example, the user typed "coventry" (fig1.3), and the programme output "LC UY MU AK" (fig1.3), 
which is the encrypted text we need. After this, the programme will return to the point where you choose one of the three options from the previous paragraph. 
Decrypting the cypher text output requires pressing "2" to execute the decryption algorithm. After entering the text to be decrypted, as shown in (fig1.4),
the user will receive the decrypted text/phrase, which in this example was "COVENTRY," the word that was initially encrypted. If you press "3" to quit, 
the app will thank you and shut down. Run the system again.
